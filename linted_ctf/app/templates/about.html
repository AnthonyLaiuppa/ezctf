  <p>Capture the Flag (CTF) is a kind of computer security competition. CTF contests are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine, as well as conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world. </p><p> EzCTF was designed to make standing up a CTF platform easy. EzCTF was built on Flask to simplfy its architecture while still providing the necessary features.</p>
